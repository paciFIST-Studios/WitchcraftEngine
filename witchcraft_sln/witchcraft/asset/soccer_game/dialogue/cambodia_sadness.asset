				<says speaker="b" portrait="true" text="I went to Cambodia once. I was a tourist."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="I stopped to eat at this restaurant--it was a touristy place near Angkor Wat."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="A kid came up to me and asked me to buy some trinkets they were selling."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="I was so tired and hungry, that I just couldn't handle another conversation."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="So I asked them to leave, and come back when I had eaten."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="They said, if I was gonna buy something I just should, because tourists mostly lied to them to get them to leave."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="I promised I was different though.  I promised that I would buy something when they came back"/>
				<says speaker="b" text="and I promised I wouldn't buy from anyone else."/>
				<says speaker="b" text="And the kid was happy about that.  They believed me."/>

				<!-- kid comes back, I buy something, I feel good about myself -->
				<!-- but it was some other kid.  The first kid came back and saw my new trinket -->
				<!-- they looked apprehensive.  they asked me to buy something. -->
				<!-- and I didn't.  -->
				<!-- they said I had promised -->
				<!-- and I said I was sorry -->
				<!-- and they left, angry and crying -->
				<!-- and I did have enough money to buy another trinket -->
				<!-- but I didn't want to, because I wanted to spend the money at a shooting range in town -->
				<!-- the shooting range had hand grenades, and I thought I'd never have another opportunity to throw a hand grenade -->
				<!-- so I went to the shooting range, and when I got there, the prices had gone up, and I couldn't afford it -->
				<!-- it made me so ashamed of myself.  The kid was a beggar, trying to do a job in order to survive-->
				<!-- and I wanted to spend my money on 8 seconds of a new experience-->
				<!-- they trusted me -->
				<!-- and I lied to them -->
				<!-- and I even had a chance to fix my mistake, but I didn't take it -->
				<!-- and now it makes me wish I had killed myself at the shooting range -->
				<!-- I'll never see that kid again -->
				<!-- In their life, I am one of the worst liars who set upon them -->
				<!-- because I made them trust me, and then simply refused to help when I could -->
				<!-- and in my life, I carry the shame of knowing I am a villain -->
				<!-- (portrait=true) I am selfish.  I don't pay attention to others.  I don't help. -->
				<!-- (portrait=true) It makes me wish I was dead.  People deserve so much better than me. -->
				<!-- (portrait=true) But I am the only thing I can offer to them. -->
